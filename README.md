### My name is Erik Sundberg

I am currently a Master's student at UW Madison studying Systems and Data Analytics. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Economics. After graduation, I worked as an engineer and decided to pursue a career in Data Science. 

I am currently working as an Editorial Assitant for UW Madison, and I am leading the development of a website tracking the workflow and performance of peer-reviewers assisting in the management of The Journal of Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. This website is powered using a data warehouse populated using a Python/SQL data pipeline.

This year, I am developing my machine learning skills. To achieve this goal, I am taking mathematical courses in Data Science focuisng on causal interference, matrix methods, and applied machine learning. 

NOTE FOR HW2 SUBMISSION: I have realized that the structure of my website is terminally incorrect and unable to support the necessary page formatting. I will be doing a complete rebuilding of the website and transferring of my content. H

Homework 2: 

For this project, I will be examining if the position of the sun during school start times causes a change in performance. To examine this, I will be comparing schools near timezone borders. This will demonstrate the effect becuase schools which are geographically close but exist in different time zones will have differ in start times by one hour. A significant difference in performance may suggest a casual relationship between start time (relative to the position of the sun) and student performance.

The random variable in this scenario will be on what side of the time zone a school is on. This will seperate the schools into two groups. All schools must be near the time zone boarder. Schools which have a later start time (as measured by the actual position of the sun) will be the treatment group. When comparing schools, I will need to account for the average income of parents becuase it has a known impact on acacdemic performance. Further research into confounding variables will be neccesary to justify a casual relationship.

While research has already been done on the benefits of a later start date, this observational study may provide additional insites by identifying the affect of timezone bondaries. Furthermore, examination into additional timezone associations may be warrented based on the results of data exploration. My biggest limitation is that I will not be able to analyze the affect of treatment on an untreated individual. Rather, I will only be measuring long term differences in lifestyle that arise from later start times (relative to the postion of the sun).
