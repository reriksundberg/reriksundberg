# Estimation

To conduct Estimation, I will have my treatment Variable A, my outcome assignment Y, and my adjustment variables X. As I have discussed prior, I assume Y(A) is well-defined and has SUTVA. With Identification, I know that E[Y | A=a] = E[Y(a)]
 
Thus, the ideal data set should include X, A, and Y for every observation. X is a vectored value containing data known to effect average standardized test scores. This would include measures such as income, 

Thus, to implement this algorithm, we will apply a simple linear regression. We can then identify the effect of our treatment A by examining the parameter. 

(should I discuss the possiblility of other curves being more accurate representations?)
