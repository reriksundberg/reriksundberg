### My name is Erik Sundberg

I am currently a Master's student at UW Madison studying Systems and Data Analytics. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and Economics. After graduation, I worked as an engineer and decided to pursue a career in Data Science. 

I am currently working as an Editorial Assitant for UW Madison, and I am leading the development of a website tracking the workflow and performance of peer-reviewers assisting in the management of The Journal of Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. This website is powered using a data warehouse populated using a Python/SQL data pipeline.

This year, I am developing my machine learning skills. To achieve this goal, I am taking mathematical courses in Data Science focuisng on causal interference, matrix methods, and applied machine learning. 

NOTE FOR HW2 SUBMISSION: I have realized that the structure of my website is terminally incorrect and unable to support the necessary page formatting. On Thursday I will be doing a complete rebuilding of the website and transferring of my content. H

Homework 2: 

The question I will be answering is weather schools near timezone boundaries have different academic outcomes. If I can identify a casual relationship between the earliness of a start time and performance of students, it would demonstrate producitivity improvements from later start times.

The random variable in this scenario will be on what side of the time zone a school is on. This will seperate the two groups. All schools must be near the time zone boarder. Schools which have a later start time (as measured by the actual position of the sun) will be the treatment group. When comparing schools, I will need to account for the average income of parents becuase it has a known impact on acacdemic performance. I will also want to compare schools from the same state. 

While research has already been done on the benefits of a later start date, this project will provide new insights by using the presence of time zones to conduct a study in a similar method to clinnical trials. Thus, I will be able to study the affect of start times on thousands of students simultaneously. My biggest limitation is that I will not be able to analyze the effect of treatment on an untreated individual. Rather, I will only be measuring long term differences in lifestyle.
