### Identification of the effect of timezones on tests scores

Introduction
  I will how the position of the sun at a school’s start time effects test scores. To identify this effect, I will investigate this as a potential outcomes problem. Thus, time zone will be the treatment and test score will be the outcome. 
  Time zones are generally influenced by state lines. However, there are multiple states which have more than one time zone. Kentucky is a state which has a large quantity of schools in both the central time zone and eastern time zone. Education is heavily influenced by state government. By comparing schools only in Kentucky, I will remove the significant effect of state policy on test scores. This will help isolate the effect my treatment has.
Importantly, I will assume that the time zone a school is located in does not have an association with other variables which effect educational outcomes (e.g. district wealth). I believe this assumption is reasonable. Physically being in eastern or western Kentucky—when accounting for other variables—should not affect test scores. 
  Let Y(a) represent the outcome given treatment A. Y(a) will be the average high school standardized test scores of a school. let A represent the position of the sun at a school’s start time. In other words, let A represent the time zone a school is in. Let X be a matrix of all other variables affecting the outcome. The variables in X will include parental education, wealth, etc. 
	Applying this framework, we can create the following single world intervention graph:
